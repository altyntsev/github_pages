# About project

Sputnik project is a template project for developing real satellite or other data 
processing system based on [alt_processing](/alt_proc/en/main.html) framework. 

Project is based on my personal experience of creating real satellite data processing 
systems. 

This code was rewritten specially for github and not used in real projects yet.

I would be glad any feedback, contribution and proposal to apply alt_processing in the
real project.

# Disclaimer

Due to current circumstances I upload the code in quite a raw state. English docs are not
complete. But better now then never. I hope that I will have an opportunity to push the
project through to completion.
