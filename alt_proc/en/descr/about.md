# About project

alt_processing is the automation framework developed and used by me for more than 20 years
for automatic satellite data processing.

During this period of time framework was refactored number of times to meet changing task
specifications, summarized maintenance and programming experience, improving technologies.

I want to share it with the community hoping that it will find application in different
areas where Python scripts are used for automatic data processing.

This code was rewritten specially for github and not used in real projects yet.

I would be glad any feedback, contribution and proposal to apply alt_processing in the
real project.

# Disclaimer

Due to current circumstances I upload the code in quite a raw state. English docs are not
complete. But better now then never. I hope that I will have an opportunity to push the
project through to completion.
